                    <div><h3>Summary:</h3><p> My goal is to learn and start working in this
                        area, this is a continuous development, and I like to meet new people.
                        My specialty, in which I am now studying to be a builder, is absolutely 
                        not valued, which is less and less motivating me
                        to get new knowledge in this area. Therefore, I strive to get into the
                        field of IT.</p>
